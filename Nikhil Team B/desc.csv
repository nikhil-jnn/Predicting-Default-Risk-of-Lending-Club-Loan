"We knew that using our credit cards to finance an adoption would squeeze us, but then medical and other unexpected expenses made the situation almost impossible. We are a stable family in a stable community. We just need to break a cycle of debt that is getting worse."
"I had a bad year two years ago, with some late and missed payments. I'm doing much better now, but I've got fees and some higher interest bits that have added up on top of the other stuff, and it's a little crazy. I'm hoping doing it thru Lending Club will make it easier - and cheaper - to pay off."
"Lenders,  I have the ability to pay off my current debt but, would like the ability to be able to put some extra money off to the side and build my personal savings account.  The lower interest rate of roughly 7% would enable me to do that.  I'm willing to share my credit report to anyone that is willing to help out. Please consider my application.  Thank you,"
" I paid off my first Prosper loan, but had an emergency and took out a second Prosper loan, but at a very high interest rate - and I would like the opportunity to get the interest rate lowered.  This loan would be used to pay off the second Prosper Loan.  "

"i recently proposed to my girlfriend of almost 8 yrs now and everything was going well untill our pug (ody) the middle of my three dogs started limping around and stumbling all the time. well come to find out he has a tumor on his spine. not very good news for us as our dogs are pretty much our children. so the reason for my loan request is the money i spent on the engagement ring was most of my savings and then i had to take out paydayloans loans for the mylogram bill, wich is similar to an MRI. $2,700 along with meds, visits etc. well as we all know paydayloans are very high intrest and a pain to try and payback and still stay on top of regular monthly bills. they are taking a toll on me mentally and physically, falling behind on all bills except mortgage. i would use the loan to pay off all payday loans and to catch back up on bills. all was going so well and it now has taken a turn for the worst. if there is any one that can help it would be greatly appreciated, and i would pay the loan back as soon as possible. thank you very much for considering me."

"Well, I am a 44 year old with a family of 5 children (oldest just enlisted in the service) and  good stable job, earning about $85,000 per year. I have two large accounts with a major lender, and a good payment history, yet their interest rate is 18% and 13% respectively on my accounts and i am currently paying a little over $400 a month in interest ALONE. Credit score at or near 700. I am looking for some reprieve from these high interest rates and look forward to becoming debt free ASAP. I asked the lending institiution and their solution would send my credit score in the tank. I appreciate all your time effort and energy on my behalf."
"Thank you for taking the time to consider me and my request as your next investment.  I graduated from college two years ago and moved across the country to start work.  Since then, I have been working to pay down the credit card debt that I accumulated while I was a student and as I was establishing a new life.  My salary has allowed me to make my monthly minimum payments on time.  However, I was recently informed by my bank that my interest rates would be rising precipitously.  This has forced me to reevaluate my finances, and I have realized that consolidating my debt with a lower interest rate is imperative if I want to avoid losing many hundreds of dollars a year.  I have a stable income from my job in public service, and I am a responsible borrower who has never been delinquent.  Your support in helping me to consolidate this high-interest debt would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you again for your time.  "

"This loan will be used to consolidate high interest credit card debt.    Over the course of this past year my wife and I had our first child, purchase a home and received a large bonus from work.  With the new home and the child on the way I chose to spread my tax withholdings on the bonus to all checks received in 2008 this caused my monthly income to fall by $1500.  This in combination with an unexpected additional down payment for our home of $17,000 with only a weeks notice we were force to dip into our Credit Cards for the past several months.    Starting January 1, 2009 I will be able to readjust my tax withholding and start to pay off the Credit Card debt we have racked up.  This loan will help lower the interest rate during the repayment period and give one central place for payment.  My wife and I have not missed a payment or been late for the past 5 years.  My fico score is 670 mainly due to several low limit credit cards near their max.  I manage the international devision of a software company and my wife is a kindergarten teacher, combined we make 140K a year.

I am looking to pay off my credit card debts.  
"Hi! So $5,500 doesn't sound like much to be debt free. Well, when you're 24 years old it seems like quite a bit. I was foolish enough to buy into those ""bad credit auto loans"". Here is what happened.. I bought an old car. I had an extremely high monthly payment. I missed other payments on other accounts due to having to pay for repairs in addition to my monthly payment.  The money will pay off the existing loan, and also pay off some credit card debt.  I will be debt free except for my payment to you.  I don't care what the interest rate is, honestly, as long as it doesn't go above 15% (my current car loan rate).   Let me know if you can help me. I would really appreciate it. "

"1:1 Income to Debt ratio; this required excellent credit to get into this situation.  Paying off a failed business venture from 6 years past, 2 years unemployement (off the books), and 2 years very low wages; all following the fallout of the dot com bust.  I am now, again, gainfully employed in the software industry, with a stable company. (4 years)  I have recently been adversely affected by the CC company's manipulating my credit score, as a result of them cutting my available credit in 1/2, taking my balances from < 40% of available credit, to > 80% of available credit, and tripling my interest rate.  (I thought I had more time :())  Funds from this loan will be used to pay off high interest rate credit cards.   This will allow additional monthly income to go towards paying off remaining short term low interest rate credit cards; which will, allow in turn, the early payoff of this loan."
